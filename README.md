# DecisionTreeEnsemble
Exploring Ensemble Methods with Decision Trees: A repository dedicated to experimenting with various ensemble techniques, such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Bagging.

Ensemble methods based on Decision Trees are among the most powerful ML algorithms. 

## Data
We explore different ML algorithms on a dataset created from this study. 

## Decision Tree (DT) concepts
DTs are the fundamental components of Random Forests (RF) and othe ensembel methods explored here. DTs can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
